# Week 1

## Lesson 1

- Course will cover the following:
  - How we incentivize people to get things done
  - Applying psychology and sociology to finance
  - Regulating financial markets

## Lesson 2

- _VAR_ in finanace means two things, variance, and "value at risk" but when the A isn't capitalized (VaR) it means _value at risk_
  - Was invented after stock market crash of 1987
  - E.g., 1% one-year VaR of $10M means 1% chance that a portfolio will lose $10M in a year
- _Stress Tests_
  - OFHEO (Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight) started testing firms' ability to withstand economic crisis before the 2008 crisis failed
  - Dodd Frank Act 2010 requires the Federal Reserve to do annual stress tests for non-bank financial institutions it supervises for at least three different economic scenarios
- _Beta_ is the regression slope coefficient when the return on the ith asset is regressed on the return on the market
  - The CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) implies that the expected return on the ith asset is determined from it's beta
- Variance of the return of a stock is equal to its beta squared times the variance of the market return (systematic risk) plus the variance of the residual in the regression (idiosyncratic risk)
- _Central Limit Theorem_
  - Averages of a large number of independent identically distributed shocks are approximately normally distributed
  - Can fail if shocks are fat tailed
  - Can fail if shocks lose their independence
- Risk is determined by _covariance_ - a measurement of the directional relationship between the returns on two assets
