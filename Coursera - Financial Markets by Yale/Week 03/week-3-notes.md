## Lesson 8

- _Causes of Interest Rates_:
  - _Eugen Böhm von Bawerk: Capital and Interest, 1884_: technological progress, time preferences, advantages to roundaboutness
- _Compound Interest_:
  - If annual rate is _r_, compounding once per year, ![balance compounded once per year](images/01.gif) after _t_ years
  - If compounded twice per year, balance is ![balance compounded twice per year](images/02.gif) after _t_ years
  - If compounded _n_ times per year, balance is ![balance compounded n times per year](images/03.gif) after _t_ years
  - Continuous compounding, balance is ![continuous compounding](images/04.gif)
- _Discount Bonds_:
  - No coupon payments, just principal at maturity date
  - Initially sold at a discount and prices rises through time, creating income
  - Term _T_, YTM (Yield to Maturity) _r_
- _PDV (Present Discount Value)_:
  - PDV of a dollar in one year: ![PDV in one year](images/05.gif)
  - PDV of a dollar in _n_ years: ![PDV in n years](images/06.gif)
- _Consol and Annuity Formulas_:
  - Consol pays constant quantity _x_ forever
  - Growing consol pays ![growing consol](images/07.gif) in _t_
  - Annuity pays _x_ from time 1 to _T_
    - ![consol PDV](images/08.gif)

- _Leverage and its Discontents_:
  - The start of the 2008-2009 world financial crisis had to do with home buyers in US and elsewhere borrowing to buy homes
  - China today is a highly leverages economy, arousing concerns

### Lesson 8 Mini Quizzes

1. **True or False. The “term” of a contract is the maximum amount of time that may pass before you must withdraw your money.** False, the "term" is the minimum amount of time that must pass before you can withdraw your money without penalty.

2. **Why was EONIA, the European version of the Federal Funds Rate, allowed to go negative?** It is expensive for banks to store money.

3. **Select all of the statements that are true about consols and annuities:**

   - Corporations do not issue consols since they would most likely not find a demand for it: investors do not believe that corporations will never disappear
   - The main difference between an annuity and a corporate bond is that there is no principal repayment at maturity in an annuity
   - Consols are risky debt securities. Even if the issuer of a consol never defaults, hence no default risk, there is still some market risk since the price of the consol is set by the market

4. **True or False. The overall level of debt in the economy (hence leverage) rises in real value because of deflation.** True
