# Week 1

> In this opening module, we learn the basics of financial markets, insurance, and CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model). This module serves as the foundation of this course.

## Lesson 1

- Course will cover the following:
  - How we incentivize people to get things done
  - Applying psychology and sociology to finance
  - Regulating financial markets

## Lesson 2

- _VAR_ in finance means two things, variance, and "value at risk" but when the A isn't capitalized (VaR) it means _value at risk_
  - Was invented after stock market crash of 1987
  - E.g., 1% one-year VaR of $10M means 1% chance that a portfolio will lose $10M in a year
- _Stress Tests_
  - OFHEO (Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight) started testing firms' ability to withstand economic crisis before the 2008 crisis failed
  - Dodd Frank Act 2010 requires the Federal Reserve to do annual stress tests for non-bank financial institutions it supervises for at least three different economic scenarios
- _Beta_ is the regression slope coefficient when the return on the ith asset is regressed on the return on the market
  - The CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) implies that the expected return on the ith asset is determined from it's beta
- Variance of the return of a stock is equal to its beta squared times the variance of the market return (systematic risk) plus the variance of the residual in the regression (idiosyncratic risk)
- _Central Limit Theorem_
  - Averages of a large number of independent identically distributed shocks are approximately normally distributed
  - Can fail if shocks are fat tailed
  - Can fail if shocks lose their independence
- Risk is determined by _covariance_ - a measurement of the directional relationship between the returns on two assets

### Lesson 2 Mini Quizzes

- **A Cauchy Distribution is a:** fat tail distribution.

## Lesson 3

- _Risk pooling_ is the source of all value in insurance
  - If _n_ policies, each has independent probability _p_ of a claim, then the number of claims follows the binomial distribution. The standard deviation of the fraction of policies that result in a claim is ![standard deviation](images/01.gif)
  - _Law of large numbers_: as _n_ gets large, standard deviation approaches zero
- Insurance principles and issues:
  - _Risk pooling_
  - _Moral hazard_ dealt with partially by deductions and co-insurance
  - _Selection bias_ dealt with by group policies, by testing and referrals, and by mandatory government insurance
- _Federal insurance office (Dodd Frank)_ monitors insurance companies, looking for systemic risk (still no national charter)
- _State Insurance Guarantee Funds_:
  - Most US states have guarantee funds protecting insurance against failure of the insurance company (New York was first to set up in 1941)
  - Protects individuals, not businesses or group insurance
- _US Government Regulation of Insurance_:
  - _MaCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945_ reduced the complexity of the insurance industry by consolidating regulation at the state level
  - NAIC (National Association of Insurance Commission) creates standardized suggest laws
  - NAIC adopts risk-based capital requirements in 1993
  - _Gramm-Leach-Biley Financial Modernization Act of 1999_ allowed banks to affiliate with insurance companies
- _Health Insurance_:
  - Proposed in 1694 by Hugh the Elder Chamberlen
  - First US health insurance: Franklin Health Assurance Company of Massachusetts, 1850
- _Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973_:
  - Required employers with 25 or more employees to offer federally certified options
  - Designed to overcome moral hazard problem, doctors earning fees for procedures make more money if people are sick
- _US Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 2010 (Obamacare)_:
  - Penalty for individuals not buying insurance
  - Penalty for companies not buying insurance for their employees
  - New insurance exchanges; a health insurance exchange is a set of state-regulated standardized health care plan, from which individuals may purchase health insurance that is eligible for Federal subsidies
  - Insurance companies may not disallow for preexisting conditions or drop people who get sick

### Lesson 3 Mini Quizzes

- **Why were people initially hesitant to adopt life insurance?** It felt like gambling and betting on the life of a loved one.

- **True or False: The McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 reduced the complexity of the insurance industry by consolidating regulation at the federal level.** False

- **What was the key concern that led to the regulation of health insurance via the Health Maintenance Act of 1973?** Doctors received money when people were sick, and thus they were not incentivized to cure people.

- **Before 9/11/2001, insurers:** Generally did not exclude terrorism risk, which they then saw as inconsequential.

## Lesson 4

- _Portfolio Diversification_:
  - All that should matter to an investor is the performance of the entire portfolio
  - Mean and variance of the portfolio matter
  - Law of large numbers means that spreading over many independent assets reduces risk, has no effect on expected return
- _CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model)_:
  - CAPM asserts that all investors hold their optimal portfolio
  - Consequence of the mutual fund theorem: all investors hold the same portfolio of risky assets, the tangency portfolio
  - Therefore the CAMP says that the tangency portfolio equals the market portfolio
- _Equity Premium Puzzle_:
  - US geometric average real stock market return 1802-2012: 6.6%
  - US geometric average real short-term government return 1802-2012: 2.7%
  - Equity premium = 6.6% - 2.7% = 3.9%
  - Puzzle: why has equity premium been so high?
- _Short Sales_:
  - Brokers can enable you to hold a negative quantity of a tradable asset: they borrow the security and sell it, escrow the proceeds, you receive the proceeds, owe the security
  - Short sales in the United States were briefly abolished in September 2008 for a list of 799 stocks

### Lesson 4 Mini Quizzes

- **The “equity premium puzzle:”**

  - Defines the "equity premium” as equity returns minus bond returns
  - Is supposed to reflect the relative risk of stocks compared to 'risk-free” government bonds

- **In the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM):**

  - A stock cannot have an optimal holding value which is negative
  - The optimal portfolio is on the “efficient portfolio frontier"

- **The covariance between two assets is a measure of the degree to which these two assets move in tandem with each other. Which of the following is true?** When the covariance is negative, both assets tend to move in opposite direction. Hence, a negative covariance decreases the variance of your portfolio.
