## Lesson 12

- _Forward Contract_:
  - Forward is just a contract to deliver at a future date (exercise date or maturity date) at a specified exercise price
  - Example: rice farmer sells rice to warehouser
  - Both sides are locked into the contract, no liquidity
- _Future Contracts_:
  - Futures contracts differ from forward contracts in that contractors deal with an exchange rather than each other, and thus do not ned to assess each others' credit
  - Futures contracts are standardized retail products, rather than custom products
  - Futures contracts rely on margin calls to guarantee performance
