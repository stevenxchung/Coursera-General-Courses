## Lesson 10

- _Mortgage_:
  - The word comes from Latin Mortuum vadium (dead pledge) which made it into mortgage
  - The verb mortgage means commit property as collateral for a loan
- _Real Estate Partnerships_:
  - For accredited investors
  - Real estate limited partnerships represent most important example of DPP (Direct Participation Program), a class of investments that also includes oil and gas exploration programs and equipment leasing programs
  - _Direct participation_ DPPs are _flow-throw vehicles_ and investors can deduct program losses on personal taxes
  - _Tax shelters_ until the Tax Reform Act of 1986: losses used to offset _passive income_
  - DPPs escape the corporate profits tax
  - IRS requirements, notably limitation of life
- _Limited Partnership Structure_:
  - General partner runs the business, does not have limited liability
  - General partner must own at least 1%
  - Limited partners are passive investors, with limited liability, rights to vote, can replace general partner
  - General partner or associate usually runs the offerings to sell units to investors
  - Additional performance-oriented compensation given to the general partner
- _REITs_:
  - REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) were created by US Congress in 1960 to allow small investors access to real estate investments
  - Before 1960, public companies that owned real estate would be considered businesses, for which their earnings would be subject to corporate profits tax. Until 1960, real estate was typically owned by partnerships, not suitable for small investors
  - Today, institutions invest in REITs too
- _Federal Housing Administration_:
  - Created in 1934, required 15-year loans
  - Insures the lender against loss
  - Government is betting on its own people
- _PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance)_:
  - Companies such as MGIC, insure Fannie and Freddie against losses on their mortgages
  - Both Fannies and Freddie require that mortgagors buy mortgage insurance if down payment is less than 20%
- _CMOs (Collateralized Mortgage Obligations)_:
  - CMOs divide the cash flow of a mortgage pass-through security into a number of tranches in terms of prepayment
  - Sequential-pay CMOs (created in 1983): first tranche receives first principal payments, after it is paid off the second tranches receives principal payments
- _CDOs (Collateralized Debt Obligations)_:
  - Hold securities typically mortgage securities as their assets
  - Typically hold subprime mortgages
  - CDOs divide the cash flow into a number of tranches in terms of _default risk_

### Lesson 10 Mini Quizzes

## Lesson 11

- _Regulation and Human Behavior_:
  - Regulation is substantially aimed at dealing with human problems, manipulation and deception
  - Regulation goes beyond this, in dealing also with making the system work better, such problems as monopoly and externalities, e.g., "too big to fail"
- _Micro-prudential vs Macro-prudential regulation_:
  - Most regulation prior to the 2007-2009 crisis emphasized micro-prudential
